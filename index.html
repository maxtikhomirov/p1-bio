			<h2>Background Information</h2>
			<p>Ever since I was a young I had an interest in video games, computers and how they worked or ran. After graduating high school I transferred to EWU with an Associate's Degree to become more involved in learning more about the game/ computer industry which has been a great learning experience. The time I have spent at EWU has brought me a fair amount of knowledge in Java, C, HTML, PHP and more towards the game industry would be 3DS MAX, UDK, and a little bit of XCode for ipod/iphone app development.</p>
